REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo  Oct 1 (Reuters) - Worldwide deaths related to COVID-19 surpassed 5 million on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, with unvaccinated people particularly exposed to the virulent Delta strain.  The variant has exposed the wide disparities in vaccination rates between rich and poor nations, and the upshot of vaccine hesitancy in some western nations.  More than half of all global deaths reported on a seven-day average were in the United States, Russia, Brazil, Mexico and India.  While it took just over a year for the COVID-19 death toll to hit 2.5 million, the next 2.5 million deaths were recorded in just under eight months, according to a Reuters analysis.  An average of 8,000 deaths were reported daily across the world over the last week, or around five deaths every minute. However, the global death rate has been slowing in recent weeks.  There has been increasing focus in recent days on getting vaccines to poorer nations, where many people are yet to receive a first dose, even as their richer counterparts have begun giving booster shots.  More than half of the world has yet to receive at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to Our World in Data.  The World Health Organization this week said its COVAX distribution programme would, for the first time, distribute shots only to countries with the lowest levels of coverage. read more  Co-led by the WHO, COVAX has since January largely allocated doses proportionally among its 140-plus beneficiary states according to population size.  \"For the October supply we designed a different methodology, only covering participants with low sources of supply,\" Mariangela Simao, WHO Assistant Director General for Access to Vaccines, said in a recording of a conference presentation last week posted on the WHO's website.  The United States, which has been battling vaccine misinformation that has caused about one-third of the population to avoid inoculations, surpassed 700,000 deaths on Friday, the highest toll of any country. read more  U.S. cases and hospitalizations have been trending lower, but health officials are bracing for a possible resurgence as cooler weather forces more activities indoors.  Russia reported 887 coronavirus-related deaths on Friday, the largest single-day death toll it has recorded since the pandemic began and the fourth day in a row it has set that record. Only 33% of Russia's eligible population has received a first vaccine dose. read more  As a region, South America has the highest death toll in the world accounting for 21% of all reported deaths, followed by North America and Eastern Europe contributing more than 14% of all fatalities each, according to Reuters analysis.  However, India, one of the first countries ravaged by the Delta variant, has gone from an average of 4,000 deaths a day to less than 300 as its vaccination campaign is rolled out. read more  About 47% of India's eligible population has received a first shot, with officials administering around 7,896,950 doses per day over the past week, a Reuters analysis of Our World in Data showed.  The Delta variant is now the dominant strain around the globe and has been reported in 187 out of 194 World Health Organization member countries.

      "Armed forces personnel will begin delivering petrol to garages across the UK from Monday, the government says.  Almost 200 servicemen and women, 100 of them drivers, will provide \"temporary\" support to ease pressure on stations.  Ministers have also announced that up to 300 overseas fuel tanker drivers will be able to work in the UK immediately until the end of March.  There have been long queues at petrol stations this week after a shortage of drivers disrupted fuel deliveries.      Petrol prices at eight-year high amid fuel crisis     Key workers struggling to travel amid fuel crisis     Is the petrol shortage improving?  Ministers - who have maintained there is enough fuel if people buy at their normal rates - say the situation at petrol station forecourts is improving, with more fuel now being delivered than sold.  But they acknowledge some parts of the country are worse affected than others.  Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,300 petrol stations said Scotland, the north of England and parts of the Midlands had seen a \"distinct improvement\" with fewer dry sites.  But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it remained a \"big problem\" in London and south-east England, where \"if anything it had got worse.\"  He said the military drivers will be a \"large help\" but a \"prioritisation of deliveries to filling stations, particularly the independent ones, which are the neighbourhood sites\" was needed \"immediately\".  Mr Madderson warned drivers would see a rise in fuel prices next week, but because of \"global factors\" not because of profiteering.  On Friday, the RAC motoring group also said the disruption in deliveries was continuing to ease, though many areas were still experiencing supply issues.  Smaller fuel stations were facing major supply problems as drivers filled up for the weekend, it said. 'No shortage of fuel'  Military personnel are currently training at haulier sites and will be on the road delivering fuel supplies across the country to \"help fuel stocks further improve\" from Monday, the government said.  Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said personnel would be seen working alongside drivers this weekend following training this week.  In addition to the 300 fuel tanker drivers being allowed to work temporarily in the UK, temporary visas are also being offered to 4,700 food haulage drivers who are able to arrive from late October and leave by 28 February 2022.  Visas are being offered to a further 5,500 poultry workers who can come from late October and stay until 31 December.  Previously, the government said these temporary visas would last until Christmas Eve.  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said there were \"continued signs that the situation at the pumps is slowly improving\".  \"UK forecourt stock levels are trending up, deliveries of fuel to forecourts are above normal levels, and fuel demand is stabilising,\" he said.  \"It's important to stress there is no national shortage of fuel in the UK, and people should continue to buy fuel as normal.\" \n",
